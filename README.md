## Tech
I have used a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Django] - Python web framwork!
- [DRF] - Django Rest Framwork
- etc

and many other open sources...

## Installation
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AyemunHossain/Online-Course-Providor-Api
```
REMEMBER EACH FOLDER IS A INDIVIDUAL PROJECT, SO YOU NEED TO INSTALL YOUR ENV FOR EACH PROJECT.

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ source env/bin/activate
```
Then install the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ cd project
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
